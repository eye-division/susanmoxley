  ONE HUNDRED WOMEN
  100 Oil on canvas (30cm x 30cm) total measurement 150cm x 600cm

  The 100 women represent: all walks of life and show the diversity of Oxford, a city that draws people from all over the world.

  The group painting is a result of 100 sittings, sometimes in silence and sometimes involving an exchange of ideas, stories, family histories, tragedies and celebrations. Their stories are as diverse as their faces. There is no social hierarchy. Each is equal, each given her  own space and painted in black and white. In this one collective painting all our lifesâ€™ journeys have come together.

  It is a celebration of my generation of women, who previously were not celebrated outside their domestic roles, and a recognition of the choices we have each made in our lives, careers and the place we live. 10 of the 100 women have experienced breast cancer.
