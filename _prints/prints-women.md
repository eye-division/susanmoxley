      1in 9 is a series of prints 105cm x 80


      These are bold, graphic, unemotional, yet sensual images which tell my
      story of breast cancer.


      Like Venus de Milo and other mutilated classical sculptures they have a
      beauty dispite their missing parts.

      110 WOMEN represent the diversity of the women in Oxford.


      The 100 women represent: all walks of life and show the diversity of
      Oxford, a city that draws people from all over the world.<br>The group
      painting is a result of 100 sittings, sometimes in silence and sometimes
      involving an exchange of ideas, stories, family histories, tragedies and
      celebrations. Their stories are as diverse as their faces. There is no
      social hierarchy. Each is equal, each given her&nbsp; own space and
      painted in monochrome. In this one collective painting all our lifesâ€™
      journeys have come together.<br>10 of the 100 women have experienced
      breast cancer.
