title: COVID  Prints
description_markdown: >-
  These Monoprints are inspired by Covid over the last year since the start of
  the Pandemic.In Greek, the word for 'inspire' is made up of 2 words: 'take in'
  and 'spirit/ breath/ feeling'


  During covid, I felt scared, confused and angry so I began with some scared,
  confused and angry marks on paper. I felt even more confused when I had done
  them, but there was something in those marks that was talking to me and
  connecting to the feelings that had 'inspired' me.The marks were relating to
  the round spikey Corona virus shape, and so began a conversation with the
  work. I added to the shapes, then I noticed that the shapes seemed to be
  floating about, I added colour to give them space and more movement, I turned
  the paper upside down I cut it up and rearranged the pieces, sometimes making
  the picture balanced and then unbalancing it. Always holding onto the feeling
  that had inspired me.When I finished the piece, I realised it was looking
  confused, scared and angry.I had given those feelings form and shape on paper.
