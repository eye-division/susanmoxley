title: "School commissions - stained glass"
description_markdown: >-
  Susan Moxley has completed large commissions in stained glass for schools and institutions as well as smaller works for private homes. Her windows are always instantly recognisable through her use of colour,  line and unique symbolic imagery.

  In all her windows she works closely with the client or does workshops in schools where the children are encouraged to draw their ideas. She often reproduces the children's drawings onto the glass which gives them a feeling of  involvement in a lasting installation. She carries this ancient craft into the contemporary world.
