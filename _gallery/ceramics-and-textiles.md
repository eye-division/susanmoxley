title: 'Ceramics and textiles '
description_markdown: >-
  ‘For many years I have collected stories, and island myths from the women on
  an island village in Greece.I have  found and gathered old, discarded, hand
  spun yarns and woven fabrics. Their patinas, stains, and darned patches all
  contribute to a story of the island’s community and past austerity inspiring
  me to work on the textiles.’


  Each is a Palimpsest- altered, superimposed and re-connectorized, they carry
  the old narratives into the present, while they still bare traces of their
  earlier use.
