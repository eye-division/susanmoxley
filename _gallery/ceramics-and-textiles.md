title: 'Ceramics and textiles '
description_markdown: >-
  ‘For many years I have collected stories, wisdom and island myths from the
  women of my island village in Greece and found and gathered old, discarded,
  hand spun yarns and woven fabrics. Their patinas, stains, and darned patches
  all contribute to a story of the island’s community and past austerity
  inspiring me to work on the textiles.’


  Each is a Palimpsest- altered, superimposed, re-connectorized, they carry the
  old narratives into the present, while they still bearing traces of their
  earlier use.
