description_markdown: >-
  The  leaded stained glass window was commissioned to commemorate the opening of the the University of Reading Museum of Rural Life in 2005.

  The window is based on Michael O"Connell's Variety of British Farming wall hangings created for the Country Pavilion at the Festival of Britain.

  The window captures the variety of British farming in a stylized and contemporary way.
